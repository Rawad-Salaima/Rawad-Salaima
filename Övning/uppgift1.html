        <h1>Basenji</h1>
        <p>The Basenji is an excellent breed for owners with nearby neighbors or thin walls. They’re a popular choice for apartment dwellers because they are generally calm and quiet pets. Basenjis are not talkative and they rarely bark unless there is a good reason to do so. These dogs reach a height of 18 inches or more and often reach a weight of more than 25 pounds. They’re a medium sized dog, but don’t require a lot of living space. To keep your Basenji in good health and well toned, take him on a daily walk. The exersise will be good for both of you and it will give you some alone time together to bond. Basenjis love to please their owners so house training and leash training shouldn’t be a problem if you use positive reinforcement methods and are consistent. Basenji’s are minimal shedders so there won’t be a lot of additional cleanup. A weekly grooming is all that your Basenji will need.</p>

    <div id="Bichon">
        <h1>Bichon Frise</h1>
        <p>Bichon Frise are a small breed of dog that do not reach heights of more than 12 inches. They, like the Basenji do not shed much and only need to be brushed once or twice a week to keep the coat in good condition. These dogs are energetic and they do need to have one to two walks per day, but they are relatively easy to train for walking on a leash. Bichon Frise are a good choice for people who have allergies because of the low shedding. They are quiet dogs who don’t usually bark unless they are frightened, terribly excited or need something from you.</p>
